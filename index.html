		Project Changelog - Changes vs Submitted Documents
		===================================================

		Project Plan Document
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		1. A pack name and settings (whether public or private) cannot be
		   edited, the pack must be deleted and re-created

		2. Database schema changed in the following ways (see db_init.php):
			- Applied AUTO_INCREMENT to more primary keys
			- In table 'file', the 'content' field type changed from BLOB to LONGBLOB
			- Added 'ON DELETE CASCADE' to more fields

		3. There are no confirm dialogs for actions, but rather colourized
		   status logs inserted into the DOM indicating whether an action was
		   succesful

		jQuery Integration Document
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		1. jQuery Fade-In animation affects are applied to whole tables
		   following fetch/refreshes rather than individual packs

		Security Audit Document
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		No significant changes to report

		Notes Relating to Course Requirements
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		- XMLHttpRequest was used rather than fetch() for file uploads because
		  fetch() does not provide file upload progress callbacks. fetch() is used in all
		  other scenarios involving AJAX

		<h2>About</h2>
		<h3>What is this?</h3>
		<p> PackWiz is an application for storing, retrieving, and managing collections of files on the web.</p>
		<p>
			Users manage collections or "packs" of files through PackWiz. Files
			can be uploaded by registered users and shared to anyone with the
			link. Packs are managed through the web interface and may be
			downloaded as a single zip file.
		</p>
		<h3>What can I do with it?</h3>
		<p> PackWiz has a number of uses including: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>A personal file storage locker </li>
			<li>Transferring files between devices</li>
			<li>Sharing files with friends</li>
			<li>File backups</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>How does it work?</h3>
		<p> <em>Packs vs Files</em> - Logged-in users have access to a File Library and
		Pack Library. Files can be uploaded to your file library and packs are
		created by entering a unique name. Files from your library can be
		included or excluded from a pack via the Edit Pack page. </p>

		<p>
		Once a pack has been created and files have been added it can be
		downloaded as a single zip archive from the Download or Download Preview
		pages. These page URLs uniquely depend on the pack name, owning user and
		pack settings, and are accessible from the Pack Library page in your
		account. Individual files from a pack may also be downloaded from the
		Download Preview page.
		</p>

		<p> <em> Packs Contain Files</em> - Packs contain any combination
		of files uploaded to the File Library. Files can be included or
		excluded from a pack individually with checkbox controls from the Edit
		Pack page. A file from your File Library can be present in any number
		of packs at once.
		</p>

		<p> <em>Public Packs</em> - Packs can be made "public" on creation.
		Public packs are listed on the <a href="public.php">Public Packs</a>
		in the format <em>username/packname</em>. Files in public packs
		are downloadable and discoverable by anyone.</p>

		<p><em>Private Packs</em> - Packs not marked "public" are considered
		private. Private packs are unlisted except within your account, and
		require knowledge of a secret key in order to be downloaded. For private packs,
		the secret key is embedded in the Download and Download Preview page links.</p>

		<h3>What are its limitations?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Packs and files have single owners and cannot be managed by multiple user accounts</li>
			<li>An uploaded file cannot be more than ~4GB or it will be truncated automatically</li>
			<li>Files cannot be downloaded until they are added to at least one pack</li>
			<li>Pack and file names must be unique, you cannot have more than one file or pack with a shared name</li>
			<li>Once a pack has been created it cannot be renamed and settings
			cannot be changed. To alter a pack delete and re-create it with the correct settings</li>
		</ul>
